# Deep-Learning-Concepts
We gonna learn about some important deep learning concepts, one must know.....

## What is Deep Learning?
- **Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data and learn patterns.
- It’s inspired by how the human brain works.
- It uses structures called artificial neural networks that are made up of layers of interconnected nodes **(neurons)**.“Artificial” neural networks are inspired by the organic brain, translated to the computer.

##  Why “Deep” in Deep Learning?
The "**deep**" in Deep Learning comes from the many layers in the neural network:
1. **Input Layer**: Takes in the raw data (e.g., pixels in an image).
2. **Hidden Layers**: Multiple layers where learning happens by adjusting weights.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction/classification.
